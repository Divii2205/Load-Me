# Load-Me
## Load Me! - README

### Project Overview
This project is a **Loading Screen** web application where users can interact with a "LOAD" button that triggers a change in the loading message or functionality. The loading screen consists of an image, a placeholder for loading text, and a button to initiate the loading action.

### Features
- A **loading image** to visually indicate loading status.
- A dynamic **loading message** that can be updated upon clicking the "LOAD" button.
- A clean and minimalistic design with custom styling using CSS.

### File Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

1. **index.html** (Main HTML file)
2. **index.css** (CSS file for styling the loading screen)
3. **index.js** (JavaScript file to handle button functionality)
4. **LoadPNG.png** (Image file used for the loading screen)

### How to Use
1. **Loading Screen Functionality**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
   - Click the **"LOAD"** button to see any changes in the loading message or other behaviors defined in the JavaScript (`index.js`).

2. **JavaScript Interactivity**:
   - The JavaScript file (`index.js`) is where the button click event is handled.
   - When the "LOAD" button is clicked, it triggers an update in the loading message or other interactive actions.

### Required Assets
- **index.css**: A CSS file that provides the layout and styling for the loading screen.
- **index.js**: A JavaScript file for handling button functionality and updating the loading message.
- **LoadPNG.png**: An image file used as the loading icon and favicon.

### Browser Compatibility
- This project is designed to work across all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Ensure that your browser supports JavaScript for the "LOAD" button functionality to work properly.

### Future Enhancements
- Add animations to the loading icon for a more dynamic experience.
- Update the JavaScript to handle different loading states or progress indicators.
- Implement a fake loading sequence that changes the loading text or progress over time.
- Style the loading button with hover effects and transitions.
